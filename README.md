# Screencast
A self-made screencasting application built in Python. This basically applies the fact that many pictures taken at small intervals of time can be made into a video. Here the pictures are basically the screenshots.

### Requirements

* Python3
* scrot
* ffmpeg

### Explanation

#### screenshot.py

This program is used to take the screenshots continuously for an interval of time given as an input argument.

#### move.sh

A Shell script to move the video from the Screenshots directory to the Videos directory.

### To run the entire application

Just run 
```
./run.sh x
```
Where x is the time of capture in seconds.

### Future improvements

* To make sure that the video is made smoother.
* To take the screenshots of just a portion of the screen, taken as user input.
